    "COVID-19 has caused many hospitals to be overcrowded and taken many lives worldwide. Our team used deep learning to help reduce the effects of COVID-19. We believe that deep learning would provide value in smart cities and hospitals where it can reduce the exposure of health workers to the virus and give faster and better detection results. Our idea is to use AI and deep learning to have zero exposure to patients testing for COVID-19, which is achieved by introducing an X-Ray room that has a robot that will scan patients and provide immediate results and further instructions to the patient. Also, in the future we can train the model to predict other diseases. "
